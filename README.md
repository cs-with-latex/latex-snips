# Nvim Snippets for LaTeX

Based on [Castel's Snippets](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/),
our snippets are specially tailored to satisfy the needs of CS learning.

The following subjects are involved:

- Calculus
- Linear Algebra

C and C++ are not involved, because they are too easy.

## Special Features

- `sinsr2x+1` => $sin^2\left(2x+1\right)$
- `sin2x+1  psr` => $sin^2\left(2x+1\right)$
- `f'''n  x+2  ptd5  ` => $f^{^{(n)}5}\left(x+2\right)$

## Limitation

- `fsr` is not supported, you should `fx  psr`
- function subscript is not supported
